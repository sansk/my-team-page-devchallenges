## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

I Used React and Tailwind CSS. Create a JSON file with the team details. Used props, state. Used `fetch()` to get the json file and update the state.
It has a Card for each team member with their Job title displayed vertically. Used `writing-mode` css property (It is yet to be supported in Tailwind CSS). 

Added Animations to header and the team card.

Things that can be done:
1. Find a way to style cards individually in grids.
